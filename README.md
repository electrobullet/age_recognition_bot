# age_recognition_bot
Telegram bot for age and gender recognition powered by aiogram and OpenVINOâ„¢.  
Message processing and image inference is completely asynchronous.  

> At the moment, the bot does not have a permanent hosting, but I run it from time to time.  
> You can send a message [here](https://t.me/age_recognition_bot). It will be processed as soon as the bot appears on the network.
